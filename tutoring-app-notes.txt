:: REACT THEORY ::

HTML create a "Document Object Model" or DOM which is a tree like structure to organise and link all the web pages. 

React removes the need to query DOM elements. Instead it uses components to write reusable, modular code that abstract away some of the finer details. E.g. a button, a side bar, a grid of items etc. these are all components which come together to make the app.

Vanilla JS is plain JS with no third party code. 
TS is used for plain typescript files, while TSX file extension is used for react components. either use a js class or js function. function based components are more popular these days so we will use. 

In the project structure for the new web app, we have some config files for the typescript compiler, a node_modules folder, a "public" folder for certain assets, and then the source folder called "src" which contains our typescript and css files.
Outside of this we have the index.html file which contains the project. it loads in the js and css files we will write.

Currently we have a component tree with parent (App) and child (Message). from this a JS structure is built called a virtual DOM. it's a light weight representation of the html DOM. the "nodes" in the virtual DOM are updated only when a change is made in the code in the components. react DOM is the library that enables these dynamic and fast changes to be implemented.
This is the "react-dom" we see as a dependency for the project.

Library vs Framework

A library provides specific functionality 
A framework is a set of tools and guidelines for building apps e.g. xamarin or .NET
React is just a tool, i.e. lib, for building a dynamic and interactive UI. but we need other tools for routing, making http calls, managing app state, displaying animations, validating forms etc. we can use any tools for any of these jobs because react is not limited to a specific toolset.

Props vs States of components
Props are the input or arguments passed to a component function
States are like the local variables inside a function for storing data about changes happening in the component
Props should be considered immutable, i.e. read-only, whereas states are data we expect will change.
Changing a prop of a component from within a component after it has been declared is bad practice, i.e. an antipattern in React.

Using the React Developer Tools Chrome Extension

Download from Chrome store. Ctrl+Shift+C to open the Inspect window.
Click the >> button next to Elements, Console etc. in the toolbar.
Components and Profiler are the two new tools. 
Components allows you to see the children, what component is rendering the currently selected component on screen, and search for components by name. 
Click the eye icon to see the matching DOM element on screen.
Click the </> icon to see the source code.
